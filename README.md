# issue-tracker

> This full-stack application is an issue tracker built with Next.js 13+ and TypeScript.

## UI

> Styling with Radix UI and Tailwind.
> This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Backend

> I used Prisma to integrate Next.js with a MySQL database.
> RESTful APIs were implemented.
